# AI Firewall: Your Personal Defender in Web3 🌐🛡️

AI Firewall is an innovative **personal firewall** that operates at the client level, implementing Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology to safeguard your Web3 interactions. By encrypting and analyzing every incoming and outgoing on-chain transaction, AI Firewall ensures that your privacy remains intact while you navigate the decentralized ecosystem.

## The Challenge of Web3 Transactions 🚧

As the Web3 landscape expands, the risk of malicious activities is becoming increasingly prevalent. Users are vulnerable to potential scams, phishing attacks, and other threats that can compromise their assets. Traditional security measures often fall short, leaving users exposed to both known and unknown threats. The challenge lies in providing a solution that offers real-time, intelligent risk assessment without compromising user privacy or exposing sensitive transaction data.

## FHE: The Key to Secure Web3 🗝️

AI Firewall addresses these challenges using Zama's open-source libraries, harnessing the power of Fully Homomorphic Encryption to analyze transactions without revealing any underlying data. With FHE, every transaction request is encrypted, ensuring that even during the assessment phase, no user intentions are shared with third parties. By utilizing Zama's libraries such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, AI Firewall can perform real-time comparisons against a malicious behavior model, delivering immediate risk alerts while preserving your confidentiality.

## Core Functionalities of AI Firewall 🔑

- **FHE Encrypted Transaction Analysis**: Each incoming and outgoing transaction is encrypted using FHE, ensuring that no sensitive information is exposed.
- **Homomorphic Comparison with Malicious Behavior Models**: The AI agent performs intelligent assessments by comparing encrypted transaction data against predefined malicious behavior models without decrypting it.
- **Real-time Risk Alerts**: Users receive instant, private risk notifications before signing any transaction, allowing them to make informed decisions without compromising their transaction details.
- **Seamless Wallet Integration**: Designed to be an essential feature of next-generation wallets, providing users with peace of mind as they interact with the Web3 ecosystem.

## Technology Stack 🧑‍💻

- **Zama FHE SDK**: The cornerstone of our encryption and analysis capabilities.
- **Node.js**: For server-side development and execution of our application.
- **Hardhat**: For development and testing of Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Web3.js**: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain seamlessly.

## Installation Instructions ⚙️

To get started with AI Firewall, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or higher).
2. **Hardhat**: For deploying and testing your smart contracts.

After ensuring you have the necessary dependencies, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the required libraries, including Zama FHE dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Note: Avoid using `git clone` or any direct URLs to fetch the project. Ensure proper directory structure when downloading.**

## Building and Running the Project 🚀

Once you have the project set up and the dependencies installed, you can build and run it using the following commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run the tests** to ensure everything is working correctly:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the smart contract** on your intended test network:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run --network <network_name> scripts/deploy.js
   ```

Replace `<network_name>` with the name of your chosen network (e.g., localhost, ropsten).

## Example of Usage 🎉

Here's a quick example demonstrating how the AI Firewall analyzes a transaction:

```javascript
const FireWallAI = require('./FireWallAI.js');

// Sample transaction request
const transactionRequest = {
    to: '0xAddress...',
    value: '0.1 ETH',
    data: '0x...',
};

// Analyze transaction
const riskLevel = await FireWallAI.analyzeTransaction(transactionRequest);

if (riskLevel > 0) {
    console.log(`Warning! High risk detected: ${riskLevel}`);
} else {
    console.log('Transaction is safe to proceed.');
}
```

This example shows how easy it is to integrate the AI Firewall into your existing decentralized applications, providing you with vital risk assessments without sacrificing privacy.
